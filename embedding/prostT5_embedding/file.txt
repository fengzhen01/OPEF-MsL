# This folder contains residue-level embeddings generated by the ProstT5 model.
# Each protein sequence has a corresponding embedding matrix.
# Each row in the matrix represents a residue embedding.
# These embeddings are used as input features for the OPEF-MsL framework.
# Note: This .txt file only provides explanatory notes, not actual embeddings.
