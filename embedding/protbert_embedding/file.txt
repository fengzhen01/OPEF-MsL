# This folder contains residue-level embeddings generated by the ProtBERT model.
# Each embedding matrix represents one protein sequence.
# Each row vector corresponds to a residue embedding.
# These embeddings are used for comparative evaluation in OPEF-MsL.
# Note: Only descriptive information is provided here; the actual embeddings are stored in separate files.
