# This folder contains residue-level embeddings generated by the ProtT5 model.
# Each embedding matrix corresponds to one protein sequence.
# Row vectors represent residue embeddings.
# These embeddings are used for comparison experiments in OPEF-MsL.
# This file only contains explanatory information, not actual data.
