# This folder contains residue-level embeddings generated by the ESM-1b model.
# Each protein sequence has an associated embedding matrix.
# Row vectors correspond to residues in the sequence.
# These embeddings are used for model comparison within OPEF-MsL.
# This file serves as a description and does not contain the actual embeddings.
