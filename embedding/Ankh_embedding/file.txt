# This folder contains residue-level embeddings generated from the Ankh protein language model.
# Each file corresponds to a protein sequence in the dataset.
# The embeddings are stored in binary format (e.g., .npy or .pt) for efficient loading.
# These embeddings are used as input features for the OPEF-MsL framework.
# Due to large file size, the actual embedding matrices are not included in this text file.
