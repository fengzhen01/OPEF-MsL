# This folder contains residue-level embeddings generated by the ESM-2 model.
# Each protein sequence is represented by an embedding matrix of size [sequence_length x 1280].
# Each row corresponds to a single residue embedding.
# These embeddings are used for comparison experiments in OPEF-MsL.
# Note: The actual embedding matrices are not included here; this file is descriptive only.
